## Machine Learning Introduction - Occupancy Detection ##

This machine learning challenge is intended for complete beginners. To begin, download the [Occupancy Detection Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Then, complete the following tasks:

1. Use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) to display the descriptive statistics for the dataset, and figure out which attributes are available to use. 
2. Split the data into a training and testing set using a function from [scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
3. Find an classification algorithm on scikit learn and use it to build a model that can prediction whether or not a person is in a room. 

Once you have learned how to train a basic scikit learn algorithm, you can experiment with different algorithms to examine which are most efficient.

TIP: If you are unsure which algorithm to use, try following the handy flowchart included in this repository!
